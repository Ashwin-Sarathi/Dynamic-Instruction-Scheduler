# dynamic_scheduler
Simulation of an out of order, 9-stage dynamic instruction scheduler

This project was a part of course ECE 563 at NC State University, under Dr. Eric Rotenburg, for the fall semester of 2023. The goal was to reinforce learnings on out of order execution.
This technique implements in order frontend execution and out of order back end execution.
This project also tested the superscalar nature of the pipeline, having up to 16 instruction wide execution lanes tested.
